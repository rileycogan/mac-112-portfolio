# The biggest differences in republican support between '16 and '20 was an increase in support amongst the percentage of people that voted republican, it seems that the dots tend to have shifted upwards in '20. There seems to be a strong, positive relationship between support in '16 and '20. Left leaning states seem to be clustered around the bottom of the line, in areas with the lowest amount of Republican support, whereas the areas that saw the biggest increase where in right leaning states.
